  /// A builder function responsible for creating the widget that represents
  /// this image.
  ///
  /// If this is null, this widget will display an image that is painted as
  /// soon as the first image frame is available (and will appear to "pop" in
  /// if it becomes available asynchronously). Callers might use this builder to
  /// add effects to the image (such as fading the image in when it becomes
  /// available) or to display a placeholder widget while the image is loading.
  ///
  /// To have finer-grained control over the way that an image's loading
  /// progress is communicated to the user, see [loadingBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Chaining with [loadingBuilder]
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] has _also_ been specified for an image, the two
  /// builders will be chained together: the _result_ of this builder will
  /// be passed as the `child` argument to the [loadingBuilder]. For example,
  /// consider the following builders used in conjunction:
  ///
  /// {@template flutter.widgets.Image.frameBuilder.chainedBuildersExample}
  /// ```dart
  /// Image(
  ///   ...
  ///   frameBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, int frame, bool wasSynchronouslyLoaded) {
  ///     return Padding(
  ///       padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
  ///       child: child,
  ///     );
  ///   },
  ///   loadingBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, ImageChunkEvent loadingProgress) {
  ///     return Center(child: child);
  ///   },
  /// )
  /// ```
  ///
  /// In this example, the widget hierarchy will contain the following:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Center(
  ///   Padding(
  ///     padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
  ///     child: <image>,
  ///   ),
  /// )
  /// ```
  /// {@endtemplate}
  ///
  /// {@tool dartpad --template=stateless_widget_material}
  ///
  /// The following sample demonstrates how to use this builder to implement an
  /// image that fades in once it's been loaded.
  ///
  /// This sample contains a limited subset of the functionality that the
  /// [FadeInImage] widget provides out of the box.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   return DecoratedBox(
  ///     decoration: BoxDecoration(
  ///       color: Colors.white,
  ///       border: Border.all(),
  ///       borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),

  ///     child: Image.network(
  ///       'https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/puffin.jpg',
  ///       frameBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, int? frame, bool? wasSynchronouslyLoaded) {
  ///         if (wasSynchronouslyLoaded ?? false) {
  ///           return child;
  ///         }
  ///         return AnimatedOpacity(
  ///           child: child,
  ///           opacity: frame == null ? 0 : 1,
  ///           duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
  ///           curve: Curves.easeOut,
  ///         );
  ///       },
  ///     ),
  ///   );

  ///
  /// The alignment aligns the given position in the image to the given position
  /// in the layout bounds. For example, an [Alignment] alignment of (-1.0,
  /// -1.0) aligns the image to the top-left corner of its layout bounds, while an
  /// [Alignment] alignment of (1.0, 1.0) aligns the bottom right of the
  /// image with the bottom right corner of its layout bounds. Similarly, an
  /// alignment of (0.0, 1.0) aligns the bottom middle of the image with the
  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.
  ///
  /// To display a subpart of an image, consider using a [CustomPainter] and
  /// [Canvas.drawImageRect].
  ///
  /// If the [alignment] is [TextDirection]-dependent (i.e. if it is a
  /// [AlignmentDirectional]), then an ambient [Directionality] widget
  /// must be in scope.

  /// images); and in [TextDirection.rtl] contexts, the image will be drawn with
  /// a scaling factor of -1 in the horizontal direction so that the origin is
  /// in the top right.
  ///
  /// This is occasionally used with images in right-to-left environments, for
  /// images that were designed for left-to-right locales. Be careful, when
  /// using this, to not flip images with integral shadows, text, or other
  /// effects that will look incorrect when flipped.

  ///
  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// ### Why is the default value of [gaplessPlayback] false?
  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Image] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// This is why the default value is false. Most of the time, when you change
  /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the
  /// old widget and adding a new one and not expecting them to have any
  /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
  /// expectation and re-use the old widget.

  /// Used to provide a description of the image to TalkBack on Android, and
  /// VoiceOver on iOS.
  final String? semanticLabel;

  ///
  /// Useful for images which do not contribute meaningful information to an
  /// application.
